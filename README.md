# Ancestry adjustment improves genome-wide estimates of regional intolerance

Genomic regions subject to purifying selection are more likely to be of functional importance to the health and survival of an organism. Methods for identifying such regions can roughly be divided into those using cross species conservation and those using variational intolerance within a species.  Cross species conservation relies on identifying regions with fewer differences than expected given divergence times between species. This makes regions that are of functional consequence in only one species difficult to detect. In contrast, intolerance looks for depletion of variation relative to expectation within a given species, allowing species specific features to be identified. However, as the expected distribution of variation can be distorted by demography, if not properly controlled for, ancestral population source may obfuscate signals of selection. We demonstrate that properly incorporating demography in intolerance estimation results in greatly improved variant classification (14% increase in AUC relative to CDTS and 7% relative to conservation). We provide a genome-wide map of a signature of purifying selecition that is likely to be useful for identifying regions of functional importance in the human population and prioritizing variation for pathogenicity in individual genomes.
